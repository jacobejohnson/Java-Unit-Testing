Jacob Johnson - CIS 175 – Spring 2018 – DMACC – 2/7/2018

In this repo is the lab for Junit Testing, which can be found in the folder titled “junitsample” and an artifact I created showing the use of unit testing which can be found in the folder titled “Junit_Artifact.
The Junit_Artifact maven project is a demonstration of unit testing for a program that will calculate the ending balance of a money market account with a set APR of 1.3% after a number of years.  Four java files included as listed below.  A company offering money market accounts would have this tool on their website for prospective clients to calculate their profits from this product. 
In src/main/java the model package contains the moneyMarket class and the calculations class.
In src/test/java the tests package contains the test case TestCalculations and the TestRunner.
Testing was successful.
